## News
- (May 2025) We are finalising the third iteration of the [ParlaSpeech corpus collection](https://clarinsi.github.io/parlaspeech/) that includes annotation of filled pauses and sentiment in all languages and primary stress information in Croatian and Serbian
- (September 2024) We have released the [multilingual IPTC news media topic classifier](https://huggingface.co/classla/multilingual-IPTC-news-topic-classifier), built via our [Teacher-Student framework](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3544814), the model has 60k+ downloads every month
- (March 2024) We have released the [Mići Princ text+speech dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/classla/Mici_Princ) in Chakavian dialects and have successfully [adapted Whisper-v3-large](https://huggingface.co/classla/whisper-large-v3-mici-princ) to the Chakavian dialects, ensuring a ~40% WER reduction and ~60% CER reduction on unseen speakers to vanilla Whisper-v3-large
- (February 2024) The ParlaSpeech parliamentary text+speech datasets of [Croatian (3k hours)](http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1914), [Serbian (1k hours)](http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1834) and [Polish (1k hours)](http://hdl.handle.net/11356/1686) are finally out, also available as [corpora on concordancers](https://www.clarin.si/ske/#dashboard?corpname=parlaspeech_hr) and [HuggingFace datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/classla/ParlaSpeech-HR)
- (February 2024) We are organizing the [DIALECT-COPA shared task](https://sites.google.com/view/vardial-2024/shared-tasks/dialect-copa) in causal commonsense reasoning in dialectal texts! Part of VarDial 2024 @NAACL
- (October 2023) The official CLASSLA web corpora for all seven South Slavic languages (Slovenian, Croatian, Bosnian, Montenegrin, Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian), almost 11 billion words in size, have been published on the [CLARIN.SI concordancer](https://www.clarin.si/ske/#open)
- (September 2023) We have released a XLM-R-large model additionally pre-trained on large collections of parliamentary proceedings, named [XLM-R-parla](https://huggingface.co/classla/xlm-r-parla)
